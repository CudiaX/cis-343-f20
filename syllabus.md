Office Hours: 
* Tuesdays 1 - 2 PM
* Thursdays 11 AM - 12 PM
* Fridays 10 - 11 AM

The best way to contact me about the course is through
[Piazza](http://www.piazza.com/gvsu/fall2020/cis343).
I also regularly monitor the channel for this course on the unofficial
GVSU Discord,
though I will not post official announcements there and you are not responsible
for monitoring it.

I am always happy to schedule additional meetings outside of office hours,
and it is especially important with this class being online that you not
hesitate to contact me if you have any questions or concerns.
Because it is used elsewhere in the class,
my default assumption will be to set up a Zoom meeting,
but we can also chat on Discord, Google Meet, or other platforms if that is
more convenient for you.

## Course Meetings

The course lectures will be delivered asynchronously.
Synchronous meeting times will occur once weekly:
* 12 - 12:50 PM Fridays (Section 1)
* 11 - 11:50 AM Fridays (Section 2)

The synchronous meetings will be time for guided activities and questions about
lecture content.

## Flexibility

We find ourselves in very unusual circumstances this semester due to the
outbreak of COVID-19.
If you are experiencing difficulties or feeling overwhelmed or isolated,
please reach out
(whether it is COVID-related or not!)
and I will listen.
In particular,
if there is something that is hindering your ability to have a positive
experience in this course,
I will do my best to be flexible in finding a way to make things work.

If you are experiencing financial hardship,
GVSU's [Special Circumstance & Financial Hardship Requests]( https://www.gvsu.edu/financialaid/financial-hardship-requests-226.htm)
may be worth looking into.

## Course Objectives

## Important Dates

Deadline to drop with a "W" grade: November 20, 2020.

Midterm Exam: Friday, October 23

Final Exam: TBD

Note that, due to the asynchronous nature of the lectures,
exams will be taken on a specific day,
but at the time of your choice.
However, once you start your exam,
you will have a set amount of time to complete it
(e.g., a one-hour block).

## Course Policies

* All assignments must be submitted to Prairielearn and are due at 11:59 PM EST
  on the due date.
  Some assignments will require drawing diagrams that must be uploaded to
  Prairielearn.
  If you do not have convenient access to a scanner,
  there are free document scanning apps available,
  such as the Google Drive app.
  I reserve the right to specify alternate submission cutoffs per assignment.
* No late assignments will be accepted.
  In cases of extreme emergency, such as an accident or illness resulting in
  hospitalization, please contact me and I will be reasonable.
* Assignments are to be completed individually unless directed otherwise.
  You may discuss the assignments with other students,
  but every student is expected to submit his or her own work.
  If you find yourself emailing code or written solutions to another student,
  even "for reference", you are violating this policy.
* Exams will not be rescheduled unless in extreme emergencies.
  If you have a question about this, please ask me.
  The exception to this is if an exam falls during a religious observence that
  would not allow you to participate in the exam.
  Rescheduling is perfectly fine in this case,
  but please let me know *as soon as possible* if this will be an issue.
* Attendance in this course is expected.
* This course is subject to the GVSU policies listed at
  http://www.gvsu.edu/coursepolicies/.
